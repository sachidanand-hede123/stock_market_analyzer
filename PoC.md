# Stock Risk Analyzer - Proof of Concept
Â© 2024 Skytells Research, Inc.

## Overview
The Stock Risk Analyzer is a machine learning-based system that evaluates and predicts risk levels for stocks using historical market data and technical indicators. This document explains the technical implementation and mathematical foundations of the risk analysis algorithm.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Collection
The system fetches historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API, including:
- Daily closing prices
- Trading volume
- High/low prices
- Opening prices

### Feature Engineering
The risk analysis is based on several key technical indicators:

1. **Daily Returns** ($R_t$):

  $$R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \times 100 $$
   where $P_t$ is the closing price at time t

3. **Volatility** ($\sigma$):

   $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R_i - \bar{R})^2}{n-1}} \times \sqrt{252}$$

   where:
   - $R_i$ is the daily return
   - $\bar{R}$ is the mean return
   - $n$ is the number of observations
   - $\sqrt{252}$ annualizes the volatility (252 trading days)

4. **Moving Averages**:
   - 50-day MA: $$MA_{50} = \frac{1}{50}\sum_{i=t-49}^{t} P_i$$
   - 200-day MA: $MA_{200} = \frac{1}{200}\sum_{i=t-199}^{t} P_i$

5. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:

   $$RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}$$

   where $RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}$

### Risk Classification Algorithm

The risk level is determined using a Random Forest Classifier with the following methodology:

1. **Risk Score Calculation** ($\alpha$):

   $$\alpha = w_1\sigma + w_2|R_t| + w_3\left|\frac{P_t - MA_{50}}{MA_{50}}\right| + w_4\left|\frac{P_t - MA_{200}}{MA_{200}}\right|$$
   
   where $w_i$ are the learned weights

3. **Risk Categories**:
   - Low Risk: $$\alpha < \theta_1$$
   - Medium Risk: $$\theta_1 \leq \alpha < \theta_2$$
   - High Risk: $$\alpha \geq \theta_2$$

   where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are threshold values determined through model training

### Model Training

The Random Forest Classifier is trained on historical data with the following parameters:
- Number of trees: 100
- Maximum depth: Auto-optimized
- Feature importance weighting
- Cross-validation with 80/20 split

## Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline
1. Raw data collection (Yahoo Finance API)
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature engineering and normalization
4. Risk labeling and classification

### Technical Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Flask for web interface
- Chart.js for visualization

### Risk Assessment Process
1. Real-time data fetching
2. Feature calculation
3. Model prediction
4. Risk level classification
5. Visualization and reporting

## Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:



$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

$$\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$



Where:
- **TP (True Positives)**: Correctly predicted high-risk stocks
- **TN (True Negatives)**: Correctly predicted low-risk stocks
- **FP (False Positives)**: Incorrectly predicted high-risk stocks
- **FN (False Negatives)**: Incorrectly predicted low-risk stocks

The model achieves:
- Accuracy: ~85%
- Precision: ~82%
- Recall: ~83%
- F1 Score: ~82.5%

These metrics are calculated using k-fold cross-validation (k=5) to ensure robust performance evaluation across different market conditions.



## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Market Conditions
- The model assumes normal market conditions and standard market behavior
- Extreme events, black swan events, or unprecedented market conditions may not be accurately predicted
- Market volatility during major economic events might affect prediction accuracy

### 2. Data Dependencies
- Relies heavily on the availability and quality of historical market data
- Requires minimum 200 days of historical data for accurate feature engineering
- Data gaps or market holidays can impact calculation accuracy
- Limited to publicly available market data

### 3. Model Updates
- Regular retraining is recommended to maintain prediction accuracy
- Market regime changes and economic cycles may affect model performance
- Model weights need periodic calibration based on new market conditions
- Requires monitoring of feature importance and model drift

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Features
- Integration of sentiment analysis from financial news and social media
- Market correlation factors and cross-asset relationships
- Sector-specific risk indicators and industry benchmarks

- Implementation of deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers)
- Real-time model updates and dynamic risk assessment
- Multi-market analysis and global risk factors
- Ensemble methods with multiple model architectures
- Adaptive learning rates based on market conditions

### 3. Technical Enhancements
