## Introduction

**Stock Risk Analyzer** is an open-source application designed to help investors, traders, and financial analysts assess the risk levels of stocks using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data and technical indicators, the application classifies stocks into risk categories (Low, Medium, High), providing users with valuable insights to make informed investment decisions.


### Key Features

- üìä Real-time stock data analysis
- ü§ñ ML-based risk classification
- üìà Technical indicator calculations
- üåê Web interface & REST API
- üì± CLI support for automation

#### Features In Depth


- **Machine Learning Classification**:
  - Uses LightGBM for fast and accurate risk predictions.
  - Labels stocks as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High` risk.

- **Real-Time Stock Data**:
  - Integrates with the Yahoo Finance API for fetching historical and current stock data.

- **Technical Indicator Calculations**:
  - Computes key indicators such as Moving Averages (MA50, MA200), RSI, Volatility, and Bollinger Bands.

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**:
  - Built with Flask, allowing users to analyze stocks through a simple browser interface.

- **CLI Support**:
  - Analyze stocks programmatically via a command-line interface.

- **Extensibility**:
  - Modular codebase allows easy integration of new features or additional data sources.


## Methodology

The risk level is determined using the LightGBM Classifier with the following methodology:

1. **Risk Score Calculation** ($\alpha$):
   
   $$\alpha = w_1\sigma + w_2|R_t| + w_3\left|\frac{P_t - MA_{50}}{MA_{50}}\right| + w_4\left|\frac{P_t - MA_{200}}{MA_{200}}\right|$$
   
   where $w_i$ are the learned weights

2. **Risk Categories**:
   - Low Risk: $\alpha < \theta_1$
   - Medium Risk: $\theta_1 \leq \alpha < \theta_2$
   - High Risk: $\alpha \geq \theta_2$

>   where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are threshold values determined through model training

## Why This Project is Important

In the volatile world of stock markets, understanding the risk associated with a stock is crucial for effective portfolio management. Traditional risk assessment methods can be time-consuming and may not account for all variables. This project aims to:

- **Democratize Risk Analysis**: Make sophisticated risk assessment accessible to individual investors and small firms without expensive proprietary tools.
- **Leverage AI for Better Insights**: Utilize machine learning to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through manual analysis.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: Provide up-to-date risk evaluations using real-time data, enabling quicker responses to market changes.

By integrating technology and finance, **Stock Risk Analyzer** contributes to more transparent and data-driven investment strategies.

## Features

- **Real-Time Stock Data Fetching**: Uses the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve up-to-date stock information.
- **Technical Indicator Calculations**: Computes key indicators like Moving Averages (MA50, MA200) and Volatility.
- **Machine Learning-Based Risk Classification**: Implements a Random Forest classifier to categorize stocks into Low, Medium, or High risk.
- **Web Interface for Easy Interaction**: User-friendly web application built with Flask for seamless interaction.
- **CLI Support for Automation**: Command-line interface for quick assessments and integration into automated workflows.
- **RESTful API Integration**:
  - Secure endpoints with bearer token authentication
  - Single stock and batch analysis endpoints
  - Rate-limited tiers for different usage levels
  - Comprehensive API documentation
- **OpenAI Plugin Support**:
  - Native integration with ChatGPT
  - Natural language processing for stock analysis
  - Conversational interface for risk assessment
  - Multi-stock comparison through chat

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skytells-research/stock-risk-analyzer.git
   cd stock-risk-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
}

# Analyze single stock
response = requests.get(

    headers=headers
)
print(response.json())

# Batch analysis
