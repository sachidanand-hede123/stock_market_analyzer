## Introduction

**Stock Risk Analyzer** is an open-source application that combines financial data with machine learning to evaluate stock risk levels. By leveraging historical data and advanced technical indicators, the application enables users to:
- Assess risk levels of individual stocks.
- Make informed investment decisions.
- Perform real-time analysis using an intuitive web interface or command-line tools.

## Project Features

- **Machine Learning Classification**:
  - Uses LightGBM for fast and accurate risk predictions.
  - Labels stocks as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High` risk.

- **Real-Time Stock Data**:
  - Integrates with the Yahoo Finance API for fetching historical and current stock data.

- **Technical Indicator Calculations**:

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**:
  - Built with Flask, allowing users to analyze stocks through a simple browser interface.

- **CLI Support**:
  - Analyze stocks programmatically via a command-line interface.

- **Extensibility**:
  - Modular codebase allows easy integration of new features or additional data sources.

## Usage

### Web Application
1. Start the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`) to analyze its risk level.

### CLI Interface
1. Run the `app.py` script with the desired ticker:
    ```bash
    python app.py --ticker AAPL
    ```
    Replace `AAPL` with your desired stock ticker.
